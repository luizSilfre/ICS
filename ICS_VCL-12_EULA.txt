ICS is freeware. You can use it without paying anything except the registration
postcard (see "register" below). But of course donations are welcome. You can
send cash (Euro currency or US Dollars) in an envelop to my street address or
buy a gift certificate at Amazon in the UK. I will then use it to buy books.

postcards sent to me. Write on the postcard that it is your ICS registration.
